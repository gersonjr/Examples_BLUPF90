# Examples in BLUPF90 family of software
## This contribution was initiated by Y. Masuda, and finalized by E. Carrara and F. de Oliveira Bussiman

- Please note this repository contains only parameter and data files needed to execute the example. To download, install, and run the BLUPF90 family of software please visit https://nce.ads.uga.edu/software/   
-  `*.par` is for parameter files, `*.dat` for data, `*.ped` for pedigree, `*.gen` for genotypes, and `*.xrf` for Xref_ID files. For `user_file`-type matrices, the files are named as `mrEXAMPLENUMBER.MATRIXNAME`
